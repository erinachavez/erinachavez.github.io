			<p>At NYU, I am enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized study where I have chosen to study web development, computer programming, and graphic design. Thus, for 2 1/2 years now, I have consistently been taking conventional computer science courses alongside unbound art courses. At the moment, I am doing little different by being enrolled in both Interactive Computing and Printmaking. However, this semester has proved to be unique in that&mdash; although I have tried to find connections between the disparte classes before&mdash; this time I am actually succeeding.</p>

			<p>Interactive computing has thus far taught me to think about art and movement on screen in ways I never have had liberty to before, all housed within an actual canvas. Printmaking, on the other hand, has forced me to slow, learn, and carefully plan the process of creating an art piece that is intended to be reproduced over and over. In other words, the limits of programming have widened, and the endless possibilities within art has shrunk. Thanks to this, I've also been excited to connect the two; I may now have the opportunity with this midterm project.</p>

			<p>In printmaking, a theme that I have been using to create designs can be seen here.</p>

			<p>I am intrigued by the idea of repeating patterns like these, and furthermore, tesselations. However, to create these designs, and to grow and expand further, I am using computer programs, applications, and animation tools. Thus, for my midterm project I plan to create a web tool that allows visitors to create their own patterns and designs to admire, use, and share.</p>

			<p>From the start, I knew this was the direction I wanted to proceed in, but I was unsure how exactly to execute such a task in a way that I could reasonably manage. This is when I fell on inspiration from one of my favorite video games, Animal Crossing. In Animal Crossing, a player is able to create their own custom designs for use as clothing, wallpapers, carpets, flags, and more. They even have the ability to share designs with users all over the world through sharing QR-like codes. However, the interface for this rather advanced program is surprisingly simple in appearance.</p>

			<p>Thus, I hope to model my program after this, with some added capabilities. I'll bullet my ideas below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Canvas</li>
				<ul>
					<li>A grid canvas where a user can specify how many squares wide and high they'd like, as well as how large the square are</li>
					<li>Each square could only be filled in with one color, thus mitigating the difficulty of creating such a program, and distinguishing it from existing applications like Photoshop</li>
					<li>Special options that give users canvases in dimensons of computer backgrounds, phone screens, etc., as well as an option for creating repeating patterns</li>
					<li>Grid lines can be toggled on and off</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Colors</li>
				<ul>
					<li>A user will select a color they'd like to use by clicking on it&mdash; the cursor will change to reflect</li>
					<li>Sets of pre-configurated color palettes will be presented to the user to flip through and use</li>
					<li>There will also be an option for users to create their own color palettes by typing in hexcode or RGB values</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Tools</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Standard paint brush tool that fills in one square with one color as a user clicks in, or clicks and drags over</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Also, brush size can be changed according to user's input, so long as doesn't exceed width or height of drawing grid</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Eraser tool that returns squares to white</li>
					<li>Paint bucket tool that allows user to fill in whole drawing grid with one color</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Possibly with the ability to fill in shapes, but only if I can figure out how to do so</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Possibly, shape tools (i.e. rectangles, circles, lines) if I can figure out how to do so</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Saving and Sharing</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Allow user to download image as JPGs or PNGs in previously specified dimensions</li>
					<li>Give users the options to post their art to the site's home page&mdash; a time descending list of submitted artworks by all players of the game</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The thought behind this is to create a very simple database that populates if the user agrees to display their work. Every time the homepage is called, a gallery of these pieces is loaded from the database for users to see. There wouldn't be any sort of "like" features&mdash; imagine it more so as a "scoreboard" of the most recent shared pieces and their artists.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Finally, an option for a user to generate a QR code of their art so they can share with friends! I've already looked into simple plugins, like <a href='http://shiffman.net/p5/qrcode-processing/' target='_blank'>this</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
