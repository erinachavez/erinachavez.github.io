			<p>You can see my progress on my game thus far, <a href='hw5_2_game.html' target='_blank'>here</a>. Also, my original idea and description <a href='hw5_1.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
			<p>My initial go at building my program has proven to be exciting! I began with just trying to create one single grid square able to be filled in with a random color when clicked. Then, I duplicated it several times to create a grid. This took some work with nested loops, arrays, and classes to perfect, but eventually I was able to create a dynamic grid that only needs two variables to be defined to create a grid of any square size and width. In my example link above, my grid is currently set to a square size of 16px and grid length of 40 squares. Once creating this, I received some in-class help to figure out how to fill in each square with a color when a user clicks within its borders.</p>
			<p>At this point, I took a step back from my program and brainstormed the best way of formatting the HTML page, canvas, and functions of my game&mdash; the framework that these elements form is crucial to ensuring a compact, easily editable, and organized program. I have so far decided that the canvas will be filled with only the grid that the user is drawing on. Thus, all controls for changing colors, tools, etc., will be a combination of HTML form elements and javaScript functions. My first attempt at this can be seen via the color pickers and reset button in my example.</p>
			<p>Some of the initial issues I faced was deciding the best method for creating each individual square (p5 sprites vs. classes), tracking where the mouse was in relation to each grid square, and formatting the nested arrays to properly display the full grid with each square in its proper place. My ongoing issues include figuring out how to adjust the cursor to display the user's current tool and color, figuring out the best way to display the grid with either grid lines or no lines based on the user's request, and figuring out how to limit the canvas grid size based on the user's browser width.</p>
			<p>For my next steps, I'm going to work on implementing more robust user inputted values and folding those into my program.</p>
