        <h2>Why I am a Bach Flower Remedies Practitioner</h2>

            <p class="item">I have always been interested in self-care, which is available on many levels of the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Self-care is not selfish; it is the way that we can be the best versions of ourselves and truly care for others.<br><br>I first tried the Bach flowers in the late 90s while working in a spa as an esthetician. I was drawn to the idea that flower drops could address specific emotions, and I was skeptical. Having done a good amount of personal work in prior years, I was expanding my idea of what it meant to be healthy. I decided to try Star of Bethlehem to work through old trauma, and it was transformative for me. I have been working with the Bach flowers ever since, and became a practitioner in 2012. I am currently training to teach Bach Basics, a Bach Foundation approved, introductory course available in the United States.  In 2017 I will begin a graduate program in somatic studies.<br><br>By taking the step of working with the remedies, we take responsibility for ourselves and our current state, and gently remove obstacles to our own wellbeing. In all the work I do, I hope that people will experience acceptance, empowerment, love, and inner freedom, and that the remedies will help many along this path.</p>
